BINARY SEARCH TREES (BST)


BST is a special kind of binary tree where each node follows the property:
- Left child < Parent node  
- Right child > Parent node  


can be implemented in two ways:
1. using arrays
2. using linked lists


Implementation using arrays:

    when we start the indexing of array with 0:

        array: [ 5 | 3 | 7 | 1 | 4 | 8 ]
        index: [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 ]

        - Root Position: i = 0
        - Left Child Position: 2i + 1
        - Right Child Position: 2i + 2 

    when we start the indexing of array with 1:

        array: [ 5 | 3 | 7 | 1 | 4 | 8 ]
        index: [ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 ]

        - Root Position: i = 1
        - Left Child Position: 2i
        - Right Child Position: 2i + 1 


Implementation using linked list:

    each node has its own info along with the links to left child and right child

    struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node* left;
        struct Node* right;
    };


some quick points:
- when inserting a new key into a BST: it always becomes a leaf node
- inorder traversal of a BST is always sorted
- BSTs are not self-balancing
- they are great for dynamic data

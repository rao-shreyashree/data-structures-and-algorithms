BINARY TREE - notes

It is a tree data structure in which: 
    each node has at most two children 
    these children are usually called
    ' Left child
    ' Right child

Each node in a binary tree usually has:
    Data – the value stored in the node
    Pointer to left child – points to left subtree
    Pointer to right child – points to right subtree

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
};

Types of Binary Trees
1. Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children 
2. Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right
3. Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have 2 children, and all leaves are at the same level
4. Degenerate / Pathological Tree: Each parent has only one child (like a linked list)

Traversal in trees: visiting all nodes exactly once
each traversal can be done in two ways: iterative or recursive
    inorder sequence: Left → Root → Right
    preorder sequence: Root → Left → Right
    postorder sequence: Left → Right → Root

Algorithm for recursive traversals:

1. inorder:

inorder_traversal(root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    inorder(root->left);
    print(root->data);
    inorder(root->right);
}

2. preorder: 

preorder_traversal(root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    print(root->data);
    preorder(root->left);
    preorder(root->right);
}

3. postorder:

postorder_raversal(root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return
    postorder(root->left);
    postorder(root->right);
    print(root->data);
}

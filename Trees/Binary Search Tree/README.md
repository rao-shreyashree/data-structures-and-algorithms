# Binary Search Tree (BST)

This folder contains implementation of **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

---

## Overview
A **Binary Search Tree** is a special kind of binary tree where each node follows the property:
- Left child < Parent   
- Right child > Parent   

This property makes the operations like searching, insertion, and deletion efficient - with an average time complexity of **O(log n)**

---

## Traversals
- **Inorder Traversal** - left -> root -> right
- **Preorder Traversal** - root -> left -> right
- **Postorder Traversal** - left -> right -> root

---

## Complexity
| operation | average Case | worst case |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Insertion  | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Deletion   | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Search     | O(log n) | O(n) |
